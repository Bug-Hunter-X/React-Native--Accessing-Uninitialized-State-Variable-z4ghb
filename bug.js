This error occurs when you try to access a state variable in a component before it has been initialized.  This commonly happens when you try to use the state variable in the render method before the component's constructor has finished setting the initial state.

```javascript
// Incorrect
class MyComponent extends React.Component {
  render() {
    console.log(this.state.myVariable); // Error: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'myVariable')
    return (
      <View/>
    );
  }
}
```

The problem is `this.state.myVariable` is accessed before React has populated `this.state`.

Possible solutions include conditional rendering or setting a default value in the constructor.
