# React Native: Accessing Uninitialized State Variable

This repository demonstrates a common error in React Native: attempting to access a state variable before it has been properly initialized.  This often leads to a runtime error: `Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'myVariable')`.

## Bug Description

The bug occurs when a component tries to read from its `this.state` object before React has had a chance to populate it. This usually happens in the `render` method before the component's constructor has completed execution.

## Solution

The solution involves ensuring that the state variable is initialized properly before use. This can be achieved by:

1. **Conditional Rendering:** Check if the state variable is defined before using it in the render method.
2. **Default State Value:** Assign a default value to the state variable in the constructor.

## Reproduction Steps

1. Clone the repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Run `npx react-native run-android` (or `npx react-native run-ios`) to start the app.
4. Observe the error in the console.
